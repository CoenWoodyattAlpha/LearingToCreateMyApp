# LearingToCreateMyApp
I'm currently pursuing my own challenge to learn how to code my app, I want to challenge myself and fun from this challenge. My plan for creating this app is week 1-3 master Java basics, week 4-6 intermediate Java projects, week 7-9 transition to Android development, week 10-12 build adv. Android app, 13-15 trans. to flutter/dart, and 16-19 finalize. Going more into my idea for this app, I plan to develop an app for tracking stats in sports. Sports is a huge passion of mine and it would be cool to create something related to this passion, that could later even benfit me in this passion.
If any exprienced programmers in this field see this, I'm new to coding and would appreicate any mentoring. 
Im open to any comments or qeustion one might have.
