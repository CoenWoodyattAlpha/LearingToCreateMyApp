# LearingToCreateMyApp
I'm currently pursuing my own challenge to learn how to code my app, I want to challenge myself and fun from this challenge. My plan for creating this app is week 1-3 master Java basics, week 4-6 intermediate Java projects, week 7-9 transition to Android development, week 10-12 build adv. Android app, &amp; 13-15 trans. to flutter/dart.
